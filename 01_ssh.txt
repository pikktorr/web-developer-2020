// SSH - SECURE SHELL PROTOCOL
// can communicate with remote machines

// ssh {user}@{host}

// shh uses both symmetrical and asymmetrical encryptions

// SYMMETRICAL ENCRYPTION
// "secret" >> {shared key} >> "sdf2vj34" >> {shared key} >> "secret"
// can be crypted and decrypted with {shared key}

// ASYMMETRICAL ENCRYPTION
// Key Exchange Algorithm
// two separate keys - public and private
// public key - can be shared
// private key - never ever share it
// public keys encrypt messages, only their paired private keys can decrypt them

// HASHING
// middleman can pretend that he's the Client or the Host and steal data
// that is why encryption is extended with Hashing too
// hashed message can't be encrypted without key and authentication

1. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
2. Arrive at Symmetric Key
3. Make sure of no funny business
4. Authenticate User
